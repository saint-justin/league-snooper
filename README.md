# LEAGUE OF LEGENDS MASTERY SNOOPER
Snooping on your friend's mastery has never been easier! Use this simple tool to pull up and snoop on your friend's mastery. Just nagivate to [jvaughn.org/mastery](https://jvaughn.org/mastery "Mastery Snooper"), pop in your friends name, and snoop away at their top 16 champions by mastery!

This project is _not_ publically released yet. This is a personal project and has a ways to go before I apply for a long-term API project key from Riot. As such, the project will go down at times. If you consistently get an invalid summoner name error, that means my development key has expired. Please reach out to me (email below) so I can get a fresh API key for your testing. 

## BUGS
Please contact me if you find any bugs in the project. Name validation hasn't been 100% tested yet, so you may see blank champion splash art. Submit an issue this repo, email me (contact below), or talk to me in person about what the issue is and I'll work through it with you.

## Development
This is a project in development by Justin Vaughn built with React using the [Riot Games/League of Legends API's](https://developer.riotgames.com/ "Riot Develper Portal"). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns feel free to reach out to me at jtv6445@rit.edu

### Development Stack
This project was built using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/ "React Homepage") mixed with [SASS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass "Node-SASS NPM Page") and  for all front-end work and [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ "AWS Homepage") (specifically an API Gateway and a set of Lambda functions) to forward all API calls while keeping my API key safe. Also used was the [Fetch library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch "Fetch NPM Page") to make calls to my AWS passthrough.
