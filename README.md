## Development
This is a project in development by Justin Vaughn built with React using the [Riot Games/League of Legends API's](https://developer.riotgames.com/ "Riot Develper Portal"). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns feel free to reach out to me at jtv6445@rit.edu

### Development Stack
This project was built using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/ "React Homepage") mixed with [SASS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass "Node-SASS NPM Page") and  for all front-end work and [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ "AWS Homepage") (specifically an API Gateway and a set of Lambda functions) to forward all API calls while keeping my API key safe. Also used was the [Fetch library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch "Fetch NPM Page") to make calls to my AWS passthrough.
